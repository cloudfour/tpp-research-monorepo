# Star Ratings

Our `c4-star-rating` component can be used to display a 5 star rating. You can
optionally include the number of reviews this is based upon and a link to
those reviews.

  <Story name="Star Rating">
    {() => {
      const rating = number("Rating", "3.5", {
        range: true,
        min: 0,
        max: 5,
        step: 0.01,
      });
      const reviewsCount = number("Reviews Count", 455);
      const reviewsLink = text("Reviews Link", "#");
      return html`
        <c4-star-rating
          rating="${rating}"
          reviews-count="${reviewsCount}"
          reviews-link="${reviewsLink}"
        ></c4-star-rating>
