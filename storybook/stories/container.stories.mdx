# Containers

Our `c4-container` component can be used to wrap and contain content. It has
modifiers for consistent `max-width`, `padding`, and theming that can be applied with props.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Container">
    {() => {
      const isProse = boolean("is-prose", false);
      const isTall = boolean("is-tall", false);
      const isDark = boolean("is-dark", false);
      return html`
        <c4-container
          is-prose="${isProse}"
          is-tall="${isTall}"
          is-dark="${isDark}"
        >
          <p>
            This is the content of the container. As you can see when the text
            becomes very long it will wrap at predefined breakpoints on large
            screens. Depending on whether the <code>prose</code> class is
            assigned
          </p>
        </c4-container>
      `;
    }}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Prose

Prose containers have a smaller max width for ideal paragraph line length.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Prose">
    {() => html`
      <c4-container is-prose="${true}">
        <p>
          This is the content of the container. As you can see when the text
          becomes very long it will wrap at predefined breakpoints on large
          screens. Depending on whether the <code>prose</code> class is assigned
        </p>
      </c4-container>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Dark

Dark containers apply a dark theme to themselves and their children by updating
custom properties. Only certain components are currently designed with dark
theme alternates.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Dark">
    {() => html`
      <c4-container is-dark="${true}">
        <p>
          This is the content of the container. As you can see when the text
          becomes very long it will wrap at predefined breakpoints on large
          screens. Depending on whether the <code>prose</code> class is assigned
        </p>
      </c4-container>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Tall

Tall containers have a additional vertical padding

<Preview>
  <Story name="Tall">
    {() => html`
      <c4-container is-tall="${true}">
        <p>
          This is the content of the container. As you can see when the text
          becomes very long it will wrap at predefined breakpoints on large
          screens. Depending on whether the <code>prose</code> class is assigned
        </p>
      </c4-container>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>
