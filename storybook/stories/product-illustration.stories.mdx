## Product Illustration

Product Illustrations house images of products. Based on the product color
passed in they also
[automatically generate complementary backgrounds.](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/generating-complementary-gradients-with-css-filters/).

By default they're displayed with a 9/16 aspect ratio, but this can be
overwritten by passing a percentage number as their `aspect-ratio` attribute.
