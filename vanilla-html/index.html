    <p>
      This project is an exploration of how web components can be leveraged to
      share components and design patterns across systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      A design system is meant to be a source of truth that is shared throughout
      an organization's digital presence. But in reality it often becomes 
      fragmented as it is shared between design tools, documentation, and
      front-end frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using native web components as a base for components we hope to
      use long-lasting, native web technologies to bridge the divides between
      these different environments. We wrote and compiled these components 
      using [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/), and used its built-in
      [output targets](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) to generate 
      component wrappers for a number of popular frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition we documented these components in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/),
      designed with them in visual design tools like [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)
      and UXPin Merge(https://www.uxpin.com/merge), and integrated them into a 
      block-based CMS editing experience with [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/).
    </p>

    <p>
      By bridging the gap between code, design tools, documentation, and content 
      editing tools, we were able to write component code once, and share it
      across an entire organization, empowering diverse teams to create and
      contribute to the design system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below you can view a few examples of how these components were leveraged
      in different environments.
